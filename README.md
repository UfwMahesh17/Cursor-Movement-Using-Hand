# Cursor-Movement-Using-Hand
# Hand Tracking Project

## Overview
This project implements a real-time hand tracking system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The goal is to detect and track hand movements, which can be used for applications such as gesture recognition, virtual mouse control, and sign language interpretation.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking
- Multi-hand detection
- Easy integration with other applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe (Google's Hand Tracking API)
- NumPy

## Usage
- Ensure your webcam is connected.
- Run the script to start hand tracking.
- Use different hand gestures to interact with the application.

## Future Improvements
- Implement gesture-based controls for applications.
- Improve tracking accuracy in low-light conditions.
- Support additional hand gestures.
